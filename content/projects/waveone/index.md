## Wave One:

### More than $500 million in exits with less than $50 million investment.

<p class="text-base">Our focus during Wave One was very IT-centric â€“ around storage, automation and cloud. During this wave from 2000 till 2015 some of our companies defined parts of the cloud landscape, and are still being used actively today.</p>

<p class="text-base">Our team was involved in technologies like:</p>

##### - OpenStack

##### - ZFS (the storage system)
##### - The first data dedupe system for backup in the world
##### - The first distributed storage system for large archive solutions
##### - The most used hypervisor in the world

### 2000 - Dedigate

<p class="text-base">Dedigate was one of the first advanced hosting providers for complex projects in Europe. They focused on large projects where uptime was highly important, managing thousands of servers on a global scale. Their automation platform was quite novel at that time and allowed them to keep the operational team small while providing the best service level agreements.</p>

### Exit: 2005

<p class="text-base">acquired by:<a class="text-green-400" href="https://www.verizon.com/" target="blank"> Terremark (later Verizon)</a></p>

### 2000 - Hostbasket

<p class="text-base">Hostbasket was the largest hosting service provider in the Benelux. Around 2005, Hostbasket had more than 35.000 small and mid-sized business customers and was a pioneer in virtual private servers and the first cloud.</p>

<p class="text-base">Hostbasket developed a unique automation platform which allowed them to efficiently manage all their customers with an operational support team of fewer than 10 people. They were also the inventors of one of the first web builder platforms in the world which the customers could use to quickly create their own web presence.</p>

<p class="text-base">Hostbasket also developed the cloud platform for Telenet, which is still widely used with many Belgium small and mid-sized companies.</p>
